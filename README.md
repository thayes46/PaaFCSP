# Contribution guide

So you want to help out! Fantastic! There are likely issues/feature requests/ bugs in the issues tab. Feel free to make a branch and start taking a crack at it.

PRs are reviewed as I get time, I still have a full time job and this is a side project lol.

This readme is VERY loose intentionally, if you want to add something just by making this file more readable, make a PR and chances are it'll get in.
